# React-Internationalisation

Internationalisation - often referred to as 'i18n' - is more than just translating text site-wide. Localised currency formats can break coding, plurals can change sentence structure, and long words in languages like Russian can cause issues with layouts.

Yahoo has created a library called 'React-Intl', which uses the i18n API through its own set of components. By providing locale data at the root of the application, these components will render appropriate text based on the language of the browser.

I created a basic online store that sells tours and events to London. I localised information about the tours using the tools 'React-Intl' provides.

I built this app with help of ([Web Designer Magazine Tutorial](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/design/web-designer-magazine-subscription/)).
